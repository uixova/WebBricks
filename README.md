# WebBricks

Welcome to WebBricks! 🧱

This repository is my personal design workshop for experimenting with reusable web components. Here, I create, test, and refine elements that can be used across different projects.

## What You Can Find
- Navbar designs in multiple styles
- Footer layouts
- Cards, buttons, and interactive elements
- Animations and hover effects
- Continually updated with new components and variations

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Transitions, Animations, Pseudo-elements)
- Minimal JavaScript

## Notes
WebBricks is all about exploring design possibilities and building modular components. Each folder contains a component or design variation, making it easy to reuse and adapt.
